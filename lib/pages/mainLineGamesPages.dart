Tekken 2 Ver.B featured bug fixes, damage balancing, block stun recovery, an improved juggle system, several new moves and modified AI. A second minor update for the arcades, still called Tekken 2 Ver.B on the title screen but labeled Ver.C (or Ver.D) in the test menu and on a sticker on the arcade PCB, enables all hidden characters from the beginning rather than unlocking them through Time Release, and the hidden character cheat codes are disabled, having been made redundant. The Arcade History port is based on this updated version.\n\nThe third and final revision was the PlayStation home version, which featured all of the Tekken 2 Ver.B changes plus a few bug fixes and modified AI once again.\n\nImproving upon its predecessor, the home version of Tekken 2 introduced new Team Battle, Time Attack, Survival and Practice modes alongside the previous game's Versus Mode. Additionally, the first game's Test Mode was now renamed Option Mode. Tekken 2 also introduced the option of auto-saving data to the Memory Card.")),
